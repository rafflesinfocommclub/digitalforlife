  <h1 class="headline">Causes of Stress</h1>
  <div class="mainContent">
    <h3 class="subhead">High Expectations</h3>
    <p>Stress can be caused when we place high, difficult to meet standards on ourselves, or experience the pressure to live up to high standards set by others, for example: our parents expecting us to achieve As in every subject. Such expectations cause us to worry about performing up to standard in exams due to the fear of disappointing our parents. It is such expectations that cause many students around the world to feel stressed out.</p>

    <h3 class="subhead">Peer Pressure</h3>
      
    <p>Stress can also result from peer pressure. Peer pressure is caused when you want to do something that would appease your peers. Here's a scenario you can think about to better understand peer pressure: Your friends are trying out a new activity and they ask you to join them, but you feel that you don't like this activity. This results in a dilemma in your head because you are torn between appeasing your friends by joining them, or probably upsetting them because you didn't want to join them. Because of this dilemma, you keep on thinking about it all the time. This is peer pressure, and too much of it can cause you to become stressed out because you aren't able to come to a decision. <br><br> Now, you may be wondering whether you are stressed out. The next page will help you find out if you're stressed, so read on! </p>
