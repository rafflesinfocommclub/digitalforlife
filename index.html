      Have you ever found yourself being stressed? Have you ever felt overwhelmed? Well, you've come to
      the right website! <br><br> We are a team of students from Raffles Institution Infocomm Club embarking on a quest to help students like you
      realise your stress and learn about healthy ways to cope with it and overcome it. <br><br> Mental health is as, if not more, important as physical health. Stress has a massive impact on mental health (and physical health), usually being the early cause for more dire mental health issues and so it is important to be aware of it and its symptoms, and be able to detect stress early. <br><br> Picture this, End-of-Year exams are only a week away, revision is incomplete, homework piling. Even thinking about it brings about an eerie sense of stress. But what if you could manage and cope with these feelings, maybe even channel them into motivation to do work, instead of letting them take control of you? Keep reading and we will show you various methods on how to manage your stress and stop this stress from developing into more serious mental health issues.<br><br>So, sit back, relax, and enjoy reading! :)
